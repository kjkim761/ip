I found that LinkedIn changes URL writed in the post. For example, when I wrote the URL https://kjkim761.github.io/searchable/CV.docx in my LinkedIn post, LinkedIn automatically changed the URL to https://lnkd.in/g5k7d3Ka. This is similar to URL shortening. The URL works by redirection(302 response code).
