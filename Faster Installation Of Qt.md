Are you experiencing very slow speed of installation of Qt? Then try this.

Did you know that Qt online installer has CLI? It does have. According to this official documentation(https://wiki.qt.io/Online_Installer_4.x), we can use mirror for installing Qt if we use CLI. For the list of mirrors, check this link(https://download.qt.io/static/mirrorlist/).

Some mirrors had not enough file for my case. Then error appeared in the installation process. So I had to try several mirrors until I didn't get error. Yamagata mirror was good!
